# What
This is intended to be a [Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree) extension that pairs with `spree_active_shipping`. I'm not ready to set aside the time to build out a full extension at the moment but I did take a few minutes to extract the relevant code from my existing apps so that I'd have something to point to the next time I bring this up in #spree.
